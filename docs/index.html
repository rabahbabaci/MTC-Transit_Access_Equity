        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This study investigates temporal disparities in transit accessibility within Alameda County, California, focusing on Equity Priority Communities (EPCs). Using a non-trivial spatio-temporal modeling approach that integrates General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) schedule data, pedestrian networks from OpenStreetMap, and employment data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, we conduct a comparative analysis of job accessibility (jobs reachable within 30 minutes) during AM Peak (7:30–8:30 AM) and Late Night (10:00–11:00 PM) periods.</p>
        <p>Our findings reveal a substantial time-of-day equity gap: EPC tracts suffer an average **32.3% reduction** in reachable employment opportunities, significantly exceeding the **24.0% reduction** observed in non-EPC tracts. This **8.3-percentage-point equity gap** demonstrates that conventional static accessibility measures obscure significant temporal inequities that disproportionately affect transit-dependent populations. Policy recommendations call for integrating time-aware metrics into regional planning mandates and targeting service investments to EPC corridors most affected by off-peak service contraction. </p>

        <h2>1. Introduction: Context, Motivation, Objectives, and Research Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Context and Motivation</h3>
        <p>Traditional transportation planning in the Bay Area relies heavily on **static, AM Peak accessibility metrics** to assess mobility. This approach fails to capture the true mobility challenges faced by residents of **Equity Priority Communities (EPCs)**, who are disproportionately dependent on transit. When service frequency and span decline significantly during off-peak and late-night hours, these communities experience a severe contraction of accessible employment opportunities. This project is motivated by the need to quantify this **temporal inequity** using a time-aware analysis to inform better policy and targeted service improvements.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Objectives and Scope</h3>
        <p>The **Objective** is to conduct a non-trivial spatio-temporal analysis to quantify the difference in job accessibility between peak and off-peak periods and measure the resulting mobility penalty on EPCs in Alameda County.</p>
        <p>The **Scope** is defined as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Geographic Focus:** Alameda County.</li>
            <li>**Equity Focus:** Comparative analysis between EPC and non-EPC census tracts.</li>
            <li>**Temporal Comparison:** AM Peak (7:30–8:30 AM) vs. Late Night (10:00–11:00 PM).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>1.3 Research Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>How does **transit job accessibility** differ between **AM peak** and **late-night** periods for all tracts?</li>
            <li>Which groups, particularly **EPCs**, experience the largest off-peak reductions (the mobility penalty)?</li>
            <li>How can the resulting **time-aware indicators** inform service planning and scheduling improvements for high-impact EPC corridors?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>2. Data and Methodology (Technical Report)</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Preparation of Origin Data: Alameda County Tract Master File</h3>
        <p>The initial methodological step was the construction of the final origin layer, a tract-level master dataset for Alameda County, essential for ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the time-aware accessibility analysis. This process began by filtering the raw TIGER/Line Shapefiles to isolate only the geometries corresponding to Alameda County and standardizing all geographic identifiers to the **11-digit GEOID** string format, which facilitated reliable merging with external data sources. The cleaned tract geometries were then augmented by merging the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s Equity Priority Community (EPC) designations, creating the primary comparative variable, and integrating relevant American Community Survey (ACS) population fields to provide a demographic context. As a measure of quality control, tracts with suppressed or missing ACS population values were explicitly flagged, thereby ensuring transparency in later normalization steps. Finally, the geometries were validated to share a **consistent Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** to preserve spatial integrity, thus finalizing the master dataset for use as the origin points in the R5 routing engine.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Finalization of Origin Data and Geospatial Preparation</h3>
        <p>The subsequent step in the data preparation workflow involved building and finalizing the core GeoDataFrame for Alameda County, which was necessary for both the visualization and the input parameters of the time-aware accessibility model. This process commenced by selecting only the required columns from the previously merged dataset, streamlining the file to essential geographic and attribute fields. The geometric integrity of the data was then finalized by confirming and setting the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to the global standard **EPSG:4326**, which is the required projection for the R5 routing engine. Crucially, the dataset was validated to ensure consistency in row counts and geometry types, while the `population_missing` flag was carefully preserved to maintain transparency regarding tracts where ACS data was suppressed or incomplete. The final cleaned GeoDataFrame was then saved, marking its readiness for the network modeling phase.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Analytical Framework</h3>
        <p>The foundation of the analysis is the creation of a realistic transportation model using the **R5 routing engine** (via the `r5py` library), integrating scheduled public transit (GTFS) with the pedestrian street network (OSM). The **Cumulative Opportunity Accessibility** metric was defined as the total number of jobs (LODES WAC) reachable within a maximum travel time budget of **30 minutes** from each origin tract.</p>
        <p>The core equity metric is the **Percent Change in Jobs Reachable ($\Delta$ %)**, calculated for every census tract:</p>
        <div class="code-block" style="text-align: center;">
            $$\Delta_{\%} = \frac{Jobs_{Late\ Night} - Jobs_{AM\ Peak}}{Jobs_{AM\ Peak}} \times 100$$
        </div>
        <p>This $\Delta$ % metric serves as the primary indicator of **temporal equity loss** and was used for statistical and spatial comparison between EPC and Non-EPC tracts. </p>

        <h2>3. Results and Findings</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Quantitative Finding: The Disproportionate Loss</h3>
        <p>The analysis confirmed a substantial time-of-day equity gap:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**EPC Penalty:** EPC tracts experienced an average accessibility reduction of **32.3%**.</li>
            <li>**Non-EPC Reduction:** Non-EPC tracts saw an average reduction of **24.0%**.</li>
            <li>**Equity Gap:** This **8.3 percentage point difference** confirms the disproportionate temporal mobility penalty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Visualization of Aggregate Results</h3>
        
        <h4>Figure 1: Box Plot of Accessibility Distribution</h4>
        <p>This box plot provides the statistical evidence, showing that the entire distribution of job access shifts downward more severely for EPCs during the Late Night period, visually confirming the 8.3-percentage-point equity gap.</p>
        <div class="figure-placeholder">
            [Interactive Box Plot Placeholder: Figure 1 comparing the distribution of jobs reachable for EPC and Non-EPC tracts across AM Peak and Late Night periods]
        </div>

        <h4>Figure 2: Choropleth Map of Accessibility Change ($\Delta$ %)</h4>
        <p>This map confirms the geographical concentration of the penalty. The deepest red areas (most severe loss) are clustered in key EPC corridors in East and West Oakland, confirming the direct link between service contraction and equity loss. </p>

        <h3>3.3 Interactive Explorer: Visualizing Time and Threshold Disparity</h3>
        <p>This explorer is an advanced visualization showing transit isochrones for six representative origins (three EPC, three non-EPC) that allows users to toggle travel time thresholds (15/30/45 minute) and compare AM Peak (Solid Polygons) versus Late Night (Dashed Polygons) reach.</p>
        <p>The map highlights how **EPC origins** often retain broader geographical reach during Late Night due to proximity to core high-frequency corridors, while **non-EPC areas** may experience a sharp reduction in area, demonstrating the complexity beyond aggregate loss figures.</p>

        <h3>3.4 Supplementary Visualization: Paired Maps and Bar Chart</h3>
        <p>The paired visualization highlights two key dimensions for the six representative tracts: **Left Map** shows the absolute $Jobs_{AM\ Peak}$ reach (baseline), and the **Right Map** shows the $\Delta$ % Late Night Impact (Loss/Gain). The analysis shows EPC areas like Oakland experience major late-night accessibility losses (deep blue), while certain southern Alameda tracts show anomalous gains (red), likely due to reduced traffic congestion.</p>

        <h2>4. Limitations and Policy Recommendations</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Limitations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>**Scheduled vs. Effective Service:** Reliance on **GTFS scheduled data** ignores real-world unreliability (late arrivals/cancellations), likely **underestimating** the Late Night penalty.</li>
            <li>**Static Job Data:** Use of **LODES WAC data** does not account for the availability of jobs during late-night hours or capture the gig economy.</li>
            <li>**Cost and Safety Exclusion:** The model excludes unmeasured barriers like **transit fares** and **late-night safety concerns** which disproportionately burden low-income EPC riders.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.2 Policy Recommendations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>**Mandate Time-Aware Equity Reporting (KPI Reform):** Formally integrate the **Late Night/Off-Peak Loss ($\Delta$ %)** metric into MTC's performance reporting to shift focus from peak-hour success to evaluating service contraction penalties.</li>
            <li>**Targeted Service Investment:** Prioritize operational funding to significantly **increase service frequency and span** (run later) on lines serving the high-loss EPC corridors. </li>
            <li>**Strategic Subsidized Micro-Mobility:** Implement pilot programs for **subsidized micro-transit** in low-density EPC areas to cover the critical first/last-mile gap, addressing both late-night access and safety concerns.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This study quantified the temporal equity gap: the **8.3-percentage-point equity gap** (32.3% vs. 24.0% loss) suffered by EPC tracts during late-night hours. By validating the $\Delta$ % metric, this research provides the MTC with a necessary tool to mandate time-aware KPIs and guide strategic, high-impact service investments.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Future Work</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>**Regional Expansion:** Scale the R5 model to the entire Bay Area to assess the consistency of the equity gap across the nine counties.</li>
            <li>**Reliability Integration:** Incorporate real-time AVL data to model **effective accessibility**, accounting for service cancellations and delays.</li>
            <li>**Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Model the direct costs and benefits of extending service span in high-loss EPC corridors to guide operational budgeting.</li>
        </ol>
