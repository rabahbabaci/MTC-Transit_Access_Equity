  <h2>1. Introduction and Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    The San Francisco Bay Area is recognized for its diverse communities and complex transportation networks, yet many
    residents—particularly those living in Equity Priority Communities (EPCs)—face barriers to accessing jobs, healthcare,
    and essential services through public transit. Traditional transportation studies often measure accessibility in
    static ways, assuming that travel times remain constant throughout the day. In reality, transit frequency, congestion,
    and transfer availability change significantly between morning, midday, evening, and late-night hours. These temporal
    differences can create hidden inequities that are not visible in conventional analyses.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project, developed under the mentorship of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), investigates how
    transit accessibility varies across time and geography within Alameda County. The overarching goal is to provide
    time-aware metrics that can help planners and policymakers design more equitable service schedules, reduce off-peak
    isolation, and improve regional mobility for vulnerable populations.
  </p>

<!-- ============ 2. Objectives and Research Questions ============ -->
<section id="objectives">
  <h2>2. Objectives and Research Questions</h2>
  <p>
    The primary objective of this project is to evaluate transit accessibility in a way that reflects both spatial and
    temporal equity. Specifically, the project aims to quantify how many jobs are reachable within specific travel-time
    thresholds—15, 30, and 45 minutes—and to compare these metrics between EPC and non-EPC tracts in Alameda County.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additional objectives include developing a reproducible workflow for processing and analyzing large geospatial
    datasets, creating interactive and animated visualizations, and hosting a public storytelling webpage that
    communicates findings clearly.
  </p>
  <p>The key research questions guiding this study are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How does transit accessibility differ by time of day (morning, midday, evening, and late night)?</li>
    <li>Which census tracts and demographic groups, particularly EPCs, experience the greatest reduction in access during off-peak hours?</li>
    <li>How can time-aware indicators support data-driven decisions about equitable transit service planning?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ============ 3. Data Sources and Description ============ -->
<section id="data-sources">
  <h2>3. Data Sources and Description</h2>
  <p>
    To explore these questions, we combined multiple datasets that describe both the social and spatial characteristics of
    Alameda County. The MTC Plan Bay Area 2050 EPC Layer identifies census tracts that qualify as Equity Priority
    Communities based on income, race, vehicle access, and linguistic isolation criteria. The U.S. Census TIGER/Line 2022
    Tract Shapefiles provide the geographic boundaries necessary for spatial analysis. Socioeconomic indicators such as
    population, income, and education were obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS 2018–2022 5-Year Estimates)
    using the Census API.
  </p>
  <p>
    Employment data came from the LEHD LODES Workplace Area Characteristics dataset, which lists the number of jobs by
    tract. In future phases, General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feeds from 511 SF Bay and OpenStreetMap (OSM)
    street networks will be integrated to construct time-aware transport models. All data were standardized to the WGS 84
    coordinate system (EPSG:4326) and stored in the project’s <code>/data/raw</code> and
    <code>/data/processed</code> directories for reproducibility.
  </p>

<!-- ====================== 4. Methods and Workflow ====================== -->
<section id="methods">
  <h2>4. Methods and Workflow</h2>

  <h3 id="methods-cleaning">4.1 Data Cleaning and Integration</h3>
  <p>
    The cleaning and integration phase established a unified dataset suitable for accessibility analysis. First, the
    statewide TIGER/Line Tract Shapefile was filtered to include only Alameda County (<code>COUNTYFP = 001</code>).
    Each tract’s 11-digit GEOID was standardized to ensure consistency across datasets. The MTC EPC Layer was then joined
    to the tract geometry using this key, and an EPC flag (<code>is_epc = 1</code>) was created for tracts classified as
    High, Higher, or Highest priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, demographic attributes such as total population and median income were merged from the ACS dataset. Missing
    population values were flagged and filled with zero to preserve full tract coverage. Finally, all geometries were
    reprojected to EPSG 4326 for mapping and web visualization. The cleaned GeoDataFrame contained 379 tracts, 97 of which
    were EPCs and 282 non-EPCs. Validation confirmed that every geometry was valid and that there were no missing
    identifiers.
  </p>

  <h3 id="methods-proxy">4.2 Preliminary Accessibility Proxy</h3>
  <p>
    Because time-specific GTFS data have not yet been integrated, a preliminary accessibility metric was calculated as a
    proxy. The centroids of each tract were used to estimate potential job reachability within a 30-minute travel time
    window, assuming an average effective speed of 40 km/h. This approach provided a first-order estimate of spatial access
    differences across the county.
  </p>
  <p>
    Employment densities were computed from the LODES Workplace Area Characteristics data and aggregated by tract. The
    number of jobs reachable within the 30-minute threshold was then compared between EPC and non-EPC tracts. While
    simplified, this proxy produced meaningful insights into the spatial structure of opportunity and will later be
    replaced by dynamic, time-aware isochrones generated from R5py network models.
  </p>

  <h3 id="methods-viz">4.3 Visualization and Reproducibility</h3>
  <p>
    A major emphasis of the project is on transparent, reproducible analysis. All scripts are organized within
    <code>/notebooks</code> and <code>/src</code> directories, and output files are automatically exported to
    <code>/data/processed</code>, <code>/visualizations</code>, and <code>/results</code>.
  </p>
  <p>For the midterm phase, multiple visualization methods were used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive Folium Map:</strong> Displays Alameda County tracts, highlighting EPCs in red and non-EPCs in blue. Hover tooltips show GEOID, population, and EPC status.</li>
    <li><strong>Choropleth Maps:</strong> Illustrate spatial variations in jobs reachable within 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Boxplots and Bar Charts:</strong> Compare accessibility distributions between EPC and non-EPC tracts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each visualization was exported as either static PNG images or interactive HTML files to support embedding on the
    public GitHub Pages site. This ensures that others can rerun the notebook and reproduce identical results.
  </p>

<!-- ===================== 5. Results and Findings ===================== -->
<section id="results-findings">
  <h2>5. Results and Findings</h2>
  <p>
    The preliminary analysis revealed several important findings. On average, Equity Priority Community (EPC) tracts could reach
    approximately <strong>75,000</strong> more jobs within 30 minutes than non-EPC tracts, representing roughly a
    <strong>22 percent</strong> higher accessibility level. These tracts are concentrated along the western corridor of Alameda County—
    spanning <em>Berkeley, Oakland, and Hayward</em>—where transit density and job opportunities are highest.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, eastern tracts near <em>Livermore</em> and <em>Pleasanton</em> show significantly lower accessibility because of both reduced
    transit coverage and greater spatial separation from employment centers. The boxplot and bar chart visualizations confirm a consistent
    accessibility gap between EPC and non-EPC groups. All datasets passed quality validation: there were no missing geometries, and
    population and EPC flag values were properly merged.

<!-- =========================== 6. Discussion ========================== -->
<section id="discussion">
  <h2>6. Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    The results suggest that while EPCs are often located closer to job centers, they still face challenges related to off-peak transit
    frequency and schedule alignment. The current analysis, based on a static travel speed, captures spatial patterns but not temporal
    variation. Once real GTFS data are integrated in the final phase, we expect to observe significant reductions in off-peak job access,
    particularly in EPC tracts that depend on infrequent bus routes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The work also highlights the value of open data and reproducible workflows in regional planning. Every step—from API data collection
    to visualization—is scripted, enabling other students or agencies to replicate or extend the analysis.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- =================== 7. Limitations and Future Work ================= -->
<section id="limitations-future-work">
  <h2>7. Limitations and Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    Several limitations remain at the midterm stage. The current model assumes a constant average travel speed of <strong>40 km/h</strong>,
    which simplifies real-world transit variability. The accessibility metric is distance-based and does not yet account for walking,
    waiting, or transfer times. Additionally, the analysis is limited to Alameda County, although the data architecture supports regional
    scaling.
  </p>
  <p>Future work will expand on these foundations by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incorporating <strong>511 GTFS</strong> feeds and building a multimodal <strong>R5py</strong> network model.</li>
    <li>Generating <strong>15-, 30-, and 45-minute</strong> isochrones for four time periods (AM, Midday, PM, Late Night).</li>
    <li>Visualizing accessibility change through <strong>Plotly</strong> time-sliders or <strong>Kepler.gl</strong> animations.</li>
    <li>Interpreting results within a policy framework to propose transit schedule adjustments and equity-focused investments.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ============================ 8. Conclusion ========================= -->
<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This midterm phase successfully built a clean, validated, and fully reproducible dataset for Alameda County and demonstrated clear
    accessibility differences between EPC and non-EPC tracts. The integration of open data sources, transparent coding practices, and
    visual storytelling establishes a strong technical foundation for the upcoming time-aware accessibility analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    By advancing from static to dynamic measures of transit equity, this work supports <em>Plan Bay Area 2050</em> goals of fostering
    inclusive, sustainable, and data-driven transportation planning across the region.
