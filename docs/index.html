<h1>🚆 Transit Access Equity: Time-Aware Isochrones in the Bay Area</h1>

<!-- ================= 1. Introduction and Motivation ================= -->

  <h2>1. Introduction and Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    The San Francisco Bay Area is recognized for its diverse communities and complex transportation networks, yet many
    residents—particularly those living in Equity Priority Communities (EPCs)—face barriers to accessing jobs, healthcare,
    and essential services through public transit. Traditional transportation studies often measure accessibility in
    static ways, assuming that travel times remain constant throughout the day. In reality, transit frequency, congestion,
    and transfer availability change significantly between morning, midday, evening, and late-night hours. These temporal
    differences can create hidden inequities that are not visible in conventional analyses.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project, developed under the mentorship of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), investigates how
    transit accessibility varies across time and geography within Alameda County. The overarching goal is to provide
    time-aware metrics that can help planners and policymakers design more equitable service schedules, reduce off-peak
    isolation, and improve regional mobility for vulnerable populations.

  <h2>2. Objectives and Research Questions</h2>
  <p>
    The primary objective of this project is to evaluate transit accessibility in a way that reflects both spatial and
    temporal equity. Specifically, the project aims to quantify how many jobs are reachable within specific t

<!-- ===================== 5. Results and Findings ===================== -->
<section id="results-findings">
  <h2>5. Results and Findings</h2>
  <p>
    The preliminary analysis revealed several important findings. On average, Equity Priority Community (EPC) tracts could reach
    approximately <strong>75,000</strong> more jobs within 30 minutes than non-EPC tracts, representing roughly a
    <strong>22 percent</strong> higher accessibility level. These tracts are concentrated along the western corridor of Alameda County—
    spanning <em>Berkeley, Oakland, and Hayward</em>—where transit density and job opportunities are highest.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, eastern tracts near <em>Livermore</em> and <em>Pleasanton</em> show significantly lower accessibility because of both reduced
    transit coverage and greater spatial separation from employment centers. The boxplot and bar chart visualizations confirm a consistent
    accessibility gap between EPC and non-EPC groups. All datasets passed quality validation: there were no missing geometries, and
    population and EPC flag values were properly merged.

<!-- =========================== 6. Discussion ========================== -->
<section id="discussion">
  <h2>6. Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    The results suggest that while EPCs are often located closer to job centers, they still face challenges related to off-peak transit
    frequency and schedule alignment. The current analysis, based on a static travel speed, captures spatial patterns but not temporal
    variation. Once real GTFS data are integrated in the final phase, we expect to observe significant reductions in off-peak job access,
    particularly in EPC tracts that depend on infrequent bus routes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The work also highlights the value of open data and reproducible workflows in regional planning. Every step—from API data collection
    to visualization—is scripted, enabling other students or agencies to replicate or extend the analysis.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- =================== 7. Limitations and Future Work ================= -->
<section id="limitations-future-work">
  <h2>7. Limitations and Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    Several limitations remain at the midterm stage. The current model assumes a constant average travel speed of <strong>40 km/h</strong>,
    which simplifies real-world transit variability. The accessibility metric is distance-based and does not yet account for walking,
    waiting, or transfer times. Additionally, the analysis is limited to Alameda County, although the data architecture supports regional
    scaling.
  </p>
  <p>Future work will expand on these foundations by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Incorporating <strong>511 GTFS</strong> feeds and building a multimodal <strong>R5py</strong> network model.</li>
    <li>Generating <strong>15-, 30-, and 45-minute</strong> isochrones for four time periods (AM, Midday, PM, Late Night).</li>
    <li>Visualizing accessibility change through <strong>Plotly</strong> time-sliders or <strong>Kepler.gl</strong> animations.</li>
    <li>Interpreting results within a policy framework to propose transit schedule adjustments and equity-focused investments.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- ============================ 8. Conclusion ========================= -->
<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This midterm phase successfully built a clean, validated, and fully reproducible dataset for Alameda County and demonstrated clear
    accessibility differences between EPC and non-EPC tracts. The integration of open data sources, transparent coding practices, and
    visual storytelling establishes a strong technical foundation for the upcoming time-aware accessibility analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    By advancing from static to dynamic measures of transit equity, this work supports <em>Plan Bay Area 2050</em> goals of fostering
    inclusive, sustainable, and data-driven transportation planning across the region.
